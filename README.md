# Julian Rosado's Gnosis Visual / Web Designer Entry
## Limitations
- Without access to the the original font, I used similar looking fonts. Headline is "Bitter" and body copy is "Inter" (both available as Google Fonts.)
- I used the existing Gnosis Twitter Space announcement as a basis for my copy for realism (vs lorem ipsum). For consistency, I also wanted to include the "Gardens" logomark. Without the original file I had to fudge the logo to work in these designs.

## Brainstorm

Though I only have one "official" entry, I thought you'd like to see how I got there as I experimented a bit as I had it for my own use.

After digesting the guidelines, I took two "base" layouts to quickly build out some announcements off of. Though I did like the initial (first) version, I thought there was something to the second one. After iterating on it a bit I created a version that did everything I wanted it to (regarding motion, depth, readability, etc.) I created a fourth (the bottom) version to see if I was further inspired by being experimental, but I did not like it more than my original selection.
